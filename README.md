# Loan Eligibility Checker - Machine Learning Project

Welcome to the Loan Eligibility Checker project! This repository contains the code and documentation for a machine learning model that predicts loan eligibility based on various features.Loans are a crucial necessity in contemporary society, serving as a significant source of profit for banks. They fulfill various needs, aiding students in managing educational and living expenses and enabling individuals to afford luxuries such as homes and cars. However, determining the eligibility of an applicant for a loan entails considering numerous factors. In this project, we aim to develop a predictive model that utilizes applicant background information, such as gender, marital status, and income, to determine whether a loan application is likely to be approved.

## Overview

The Loan Eligibility Checker project aims to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts whether an individual is eligible for a loan based on their attributes such as income, credit score, employment status, etc.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Clean the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. This step is crucial for the model's accuracy and generalization. 
   - Impute missing values, standardize or normalize features, and deal with any data anomalies.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand the relationships between different variables, identify patterns, and gain insights.
   - Utilize visualization tools to visualize the data and identify trends and correlations.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Create new features or modify existing ones to improve the model's performance.
   - Transform variables, create interaction terms, or encode categorical variables as necessary.

4. **Data Splitting**:
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - The training set is used to train the model, while the testing set is used to evaluate its performance.

5. **Model Selection**:
   - Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm for the loan approval prediction task.
   - Common algorithms include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines.

6. **Model Training**:
   - Train the selected model using the training dataset.
   - Feed the algorithm with features and corresponding labels and let it learn the patterns in the data.

7. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model's performance on the testing dataset using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
   - Aim to achieve high accuracy and robust performance on unseen data.

## Model Performance

The trained machine learning model achieved an accuracy score of 82% on the testing dataset, demonstrating its ability to accurately predict loan eligibility.
